**🛍️ Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis**
Festive Retail Sales | Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

**⚠️ THE PROBLEM**

During festive seasons, retailers generate massive volumes of sales data — but raw data alone does not drive decisions.

Business teams struggled with:

Understanding who their most valuable customers are

Identifying top-performing product categories

Comparing spending behavior across states, age groups, and occupations

Making targeted marketing decisions without clear insights

As a result, marketing efforts were broad, inefficient, and opportunity-driven insights were missed.

**💡 WHAT I BUILT**

I built an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) solution using Python to transform raw festive sales data into clear, data-backed insights.

The analysis focuses on customer demographics, purchase behavior, and product preferences to answer real business questions.

**✨ Key Components:**

Cleaned and prepared ~11,000 sales records

Performed demographic and behavioral analysis

Visualized trends using business-focused charts

Extracted insights relevant to marketing & strategy teams
